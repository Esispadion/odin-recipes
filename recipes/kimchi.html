  Kimchi is a popular Korean fermented cabbage dish that's spicy and slightly
  sweet. I spent a year in South Korea and fell in love with kimchi! My friend
  Myong was kind enough to share her recipe and technique with me. Use this
  kimchi in stir fries or your favorite Korean dishes.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 heads napa cabbage</li>
  <li>1 ¼ cups coarse sea salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
  <li>5 green onions, chopped</li>
  <li>½ small white onion, minced</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>5 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean chili powder)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Cut cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends.</li>
  <li>Rinse and cut into pieces about 2 inches square.</li>
  <li>
    Place cabbage into large resealable bags; sprinkle salt evenly over leaves
    to coat.
  </li>
  <li>Use your hands to rub salt into cabbage.</li>
  <li>Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6 hours.</li>
  <li>
    Rinse cabbage leaves under cold water, at least 2 to 3 times, to remove most
    of the salt; drain and squeeze out any excess liquid.
  </li>
  <li>Place rinsed cabbage in a large container with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
  <li>
    Stir in fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar, and ginger.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sprinkle Korean chili powder over the mixture; wear plastic gloves to
    protect your hands and rub chili powder into cabbage leaves until evenly
    coated.
  </li>
  <li>Seal the container and set in a cool, dry place.</li>
  <li>Leave undisturbed for 4 days.</li>
  <li>
    Refrigerate before serving, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month
    (if it lasts that long!).
  </li>
</ol>
